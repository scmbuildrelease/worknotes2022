Since Gradle 4.3 you can use org.gradle.console property in gradle.properties:
org.gradle.console=rich


Create a file called gradle.properties inside your ~/.gradle/ folder.
Inside gradle.properties, add the line org.gradle.console=rich.

y default, the build cache is not enabled. You can enable the build cache in a couple of ways:
Run with --build-cache on the command-line
Gradle will use the build cache for this build only.
Put org.gradle.caching=true in your gradle.properties
Gradle will try to reuse outputs from previous builds for all builds, unless explicitly disabled with --no-build-cache.


A task needs to opt-in to being cacheable (see Cacheable tasks), since it doesn't make sense for every task to be cacheable.
Opting in can happen by annotating the task with @CacheableTask or by using task.outputs.cacheIf { true }, so you could do that for the npm configure task.
Note that cacheable tasks need to declare their inputs and outputs correctly. If they don't, then you may experience invalid build failures.
